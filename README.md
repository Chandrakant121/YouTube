Hello,<br>
I am chandrakant joshi as a part of mini project I created the you tube clone in unit-3 at masai school. Basically I used YouTube api for appending data on display. On homepage the thumbnails and tiltles are there with max results 20. As I passed parameter in api max results 20. So 20 thumbnails you can see on homepage.

<br>

for displaying data on display I used grid layout. I also used media quires to make this clone responsive.
When user clicking on thumbnails it will redirect to second page where user can see video. for playing video I used iframe on second page. If user wants to search any video then he can search in search box, in future i will try to add more functionality in my YouTube clone.
